    <h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>
    <p>
        In 1874 Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood, and
        fossil fuels were not available. Orlando Darling built a dam across the
        Kansas River north of town and strung mechanical cables from a water
        wheel to power local industries. Justin Bowersock bought the operation,
        naming it "The Bowersock Mills & Power Company" (<dfn>Bowersock</dfn>).
        Bowersock's slogan is:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.bowersockpower.com">

        "By 11885, twelve water wheels drove towo flouring mills, a paper mill, two elevators, a twice
        factory, shirt factory, two machine shopsm the Leis chemical works, two printing offices, the barb wire
        works and a few other minor industries,... Rebuilding from the ince damage of 1888... Bowersock introduced fourr dynamos 
        that turned raw power into electrical energy." <i>History of Bowersock Power.</i> To supplement the old 2.4
        MW plant on the south side of the river, Bowersock recently added a new 4.6 MW plant on the north side.
    </p>
    <p>To raise funds for the new 4.6 MW plant, Bowersock signed a 25-year power-purchase agreement with Kansas City's Board of Public Utilities (BPU), saying <b>Bowersock must send BPU (annual average power) â‰¥ 
        (80% of its total generating capacity).</b> Instantaneous power is proportional to (water flow rate) x (water height difference). Because the river's flow varies with rainfall, 
        the power delivered also varies. To maximize deliverable energy, Bowersock employs a run-of-the-river policy. This keeps the upstream water level as high as possible and uses 
        whatever flow occurs with the maximum upstream level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Energy is stored in the height of the upstream water. By intentionally varying this height, Bowersock could use the stored energy to offset variation in 
        local rate of consumption or renewable power generation. But this might compromise Bowersock's contract with BPU. Therefore: <span style="display: inline-block;background-color: yellow;">Until the BPU contract ends, 
        energy stored in the water behind the dam is not available to Lawrence.</span>
